## Description

Scene to show the parametrization of the `KHR_materials_iridescence` extension with a dielectric base material. The three dimensions of the scene are:

* Material IOR: index of refraction of the dielectric base material
* Thin Film Thickness: the thickness of the thin-film layer in nm
* Thin Film IOR: index of refraction of the thin-film layer
